'''
Python Program to Find the Frequency of Characters in a String

Create a Python function named char_freq that takes a string as input and returns a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in that string. The function should be case-sensitive, meaning 'A' and 'a' should be counted as different characters.

Task Description:
Initialize an Empty Dictionary: To store the frequency of each character.
Iterate Over the String: Loop through each character in the string.
Count Character Frequencies: Update the dictionary with the count of each character.
Return the Dictionary: After the loop, return the dictionary with the character frequencies.
Example:
Input: "Hello, World!"
Output: {'H': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 3, 'o': 2, ',': 1, ' ': 1, 'W': 1, 'r': 1, 'd': 1, '!': 1}
You can use this description to write the function and then test it with the example provided or any other string you'd like to try!
